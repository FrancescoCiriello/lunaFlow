__Lunaflow - Bioluminescent plankton for 3D flow visualisations of pressure fields.__

Full project description on: https://www.hackster.io/lunaflow/lunaflow-d60cbe

The lunaFlow project is powered by the camFlowAq suite of functionalities developed by Francesco Ciriello in 2019.

For the project, we extended these functionalities to a new app that allows for simultaneous capture with 4 cameras.

Run the camFlowAqApp in remote mode to connect to Raspberry Pi boards over an MQTT connection.
